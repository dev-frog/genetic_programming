# Genetic Programming

In artificial intelligence, **genetic programming (GP)** is a technique of evolving programs, starting from a population of unfit (usually random) programs, fit for a particular task by applying operations analogous to natural genetic processes to the population of programs.


_**The five major preparatory steps for the basic version of genetic programming require the human user to specify.**_

  1. The set of terminals (The independent variables of the problem,zero-argument functions and random constants) for each branch of the to-be-evolved program.
  2. The set of primitive functions for each branch of the to-be-evolved program.
  3. The fitness measure (explicitly or implicitly measuring the fitness of individuals in the population)
  4. Certain parameters for controlling the run,
  5. The termination criterion and method for designation the result of the run.
